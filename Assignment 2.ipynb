    "\n",
    "<b>Requirement 2 min, max and mean:</b> It was decided to return None if there was no values that could be returned for the max, min and mean, as strings do not have a mean and can not be applied to the sum built in python function, as min and max can be applied to strings also these were allowed to return the alphabetical min and max\n",

Index is checked that the index passed is either a list or an tuple, these were chosen as all other types would cause a failure further on, this prevents the user from creating an series with invaid data. A TypeError is raised indicating to the user that this is invalid data preventing the instance from being created. Also the index values are checked to ensure that they are unique and if they are not the instance construction is abandoned.\n",

    "The attribute s_dict first checks that the passed series is either a dictionary, list or a tuple, all other types cause an exception to be raised, this error handling was chosen to prevent the creation of the class instance when this condition is not met. We also check that the length of the passed index is the same length as the length of the data. Finally we check that the data passed is of a consistent type, we do not allow a series to be created that has more than one data type except for floats and ints as these are allowed to be used together. This ensures that the min, max and mean will work and we will have consitent data. For example mixed series of int and string could cause problems later."

    "<b>Requirement 4 MyDataFrame:</b> Each column corresponds to a dictionary with the key representing the column header and the column values correspond to an instance of the MySeries class as per the given instructions. The index passed into the MyDataFrame was stored as a attribute <i>index</i>, this allowed for the MySeries instance to use these as identifiers for each row. This also allowed values to be sorted more easily as rearranging this <i>index</i> list changed the order of the printed MyDataFrame instance. When no index was passed to the MyDataFrame one was created inside the class with numeric values representing the rows. This allowed printing to be done more easily as the rows could be accessed with the names in this list and allowed each value from the MySeries instance to be fetched and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Requirement 6 Sorting:</b> rather than sorting the entire data frame we sort just the index which reflects the order that the rows are ouput. This allows us to sort in-place as no new copy of the data-frame is created. Form the wiki on in place algrothims https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm bubble sort is a in place algrothim, this was used to sort the index attribute which allowed the printing to be sorted. Since the columns are stored as MySeries instances, there is no sorting that needs to be done on the columns as sorting a dictionary produces the same dictionary, the order does not matter as they are accessed by key not index.\n",

    "<b>Requirement 8 constructor error checking:</b> Most of the actual data checks are implemented in MySeries, these are not overwritten as they provide all necessary detail on data being consistent. Data consistency checks in the MyDataFrame class are that the number of values in the columns passed are the same, we do not want to have a situation where there are more rows in one column as this would crash the printing process later on, this was avoided by raising a exception to the user when they try and create an instance of the MyDataFrame class with inconsistent row values. Index values were not checked as these are passed directly to the MySeries constructor which will handle any inconsistencies. The first check in the constructor for the MyDataFrame is that the data is a dictionary as described in requirement 4, an attempt to use another type will raise an error and the instance will not be created."
